    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure authorization independence, clarity, and scalability. User data and related information are stored in a way that minimizes the need for complex security rules and `get()` calls, promoting atomic operations and easier debugging.\n\n*   **Authorization Independence:** The structure avoids hierarchical authorization dependencies. For example, `EmailAnalytics` are stored under `/users/{userId}/analytics/{analyticsId}`. The rules only need to verify `request.auth.uid == userId` to authorize the operation without reading the parent `User` document. The `Subscription` is associated with the user via the `users/{userId}` document. While not a subcollection, this structure ensures the rules only need to check ownership of the user document to ensure the security of data.\n*   **Structural Segregation:** Each collection serves a distinct purpose with homogeneous security requirements. Private user data is stored under `/users/{userId}`, while subscription data is associated via the `subscriptionId` field within the `User` document.\n*   **Access Modeling:** Path-based ownership is used for user data (`/users/{userId}`), enforcing that only the authenticated user can access their own data.\n*   **QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** The structure supports secure `list` operations. For example, listing analytics for a user is done via `/users/{userId}/analytics`. The rule will verify `request.auth.uid == userId` which makes the `list` operation secure."
